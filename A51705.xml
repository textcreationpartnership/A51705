            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE <hi>Chriſtian-READER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Author of this ſhort Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe was ſo well known to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt in and about this City, that neither himſelf nor any of his holy Labours do need an Epiſtle of Commendation to them: For [though he be dead] he yet ſpeaketh by his paſt Example to Believers, in word, in converſation, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity; And by his Miniſtry which he Managed as the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of God, holding faſt the faithful Word with uncorruptneſs; and diſpenſed with gravity, ſincerity, ſound ſpeech as cannot be condemned, rightly dividing the Word of Truth, whereby as he did approve himſelf to God a Workman that needed not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo alſo to every Mans Conſcience that
<pb facs="tcp:59234:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>knew him, and more eſpecially to the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt had made him O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer, to whom in Chriſt Jeſus, both his Perſonal Grace, and Miniſterial Abilities, are acknowledged as the Auther and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of them.</p>
            <p>The deſign therefore of theſe few lines, is not ſo much to beſpeak an Acceptance with the Reader, as to Advertiſe him, That theſe Sermons were not prepared [or for ought is known] ever intended by himſelf for the Preſſe, but are made publick by ſome of his Friends (in whoſe Memory his Name and Labour yet live) as thoſe that God made uſeful and ſavoury to them when he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and which they hope may be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to all the Saints.</p>
            <p>Yet the Reader may be aſſured, That they are the true Copy of his own Notes, [the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Tranſcriber excepted] which he Prepared to methodize what of the Word he Miniſtred in his daily courſe, which were enlarged and further emproved in the lively Delivery of them; which latter if we could preſent thee with, as truly as the ſubſtance of them is here emitted: eſpecially, if it
<pb facs="tcp:59234:3"/>had pleaſed the only wiſe God to have ſpared him to a Review of them by that ſpiritual Judgment which he was ſingularly bleſt with, to deliver the things of God not only ſolidly, but in many things very ſublimely, there would need no Apology to the World, (whoſe courſe is to cenſure rather then to ſtudy profit by the Labours of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) for the ſeeming abruptneſſe of ſome of his notions, and the brevity of the whole: which laſt inconvenience yet is attended with this advantage, That the godly Reader may with leſs expence of time peruſe them, and with greater facility retain them: and the worth and weight he finds in them will recompence his labour, through the bleſſing of the Holy One who teacheth us to profit, as he hath Promiſed to all that are intereſſed in this inſeparable union to, and communion with him in Jeſus Chriſt, who will through him make us Conquerours over the unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of our own hearts, as well as all other our ſpiritual enemies.</p>

               <p>In which we muſt conſider three things, Union, Communion, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between God and Believers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt conſider the Union that is between God and Believers, which is the foundation of all Communion. There are ſeveral ſorts of Union.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A natural union; an union of perſons in the ſame common nature: ſuch an union there is between Chriſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59234:6"/>and believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. and through Chriſt, between them and God: for hereby God became <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us, one with us, and we one with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is an union by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; thus all the ſons of men were one with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of this one man, as including all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. Such an union there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and believers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. and through Chriſt with God, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.9. I will ſay it is my people, and they, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is an union of Amity or Affection, as between <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.11. <hi>and</hi> 20.17. as between thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. ſuch an union is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween believers and Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. Chriſt loved his Church, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.— Such alſo between God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, now reconciled by Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there is a Conjugal union of perſons by Marriage, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.28, 31. ſuch an union there is between Chriſt and believers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. and ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59234:6"/>God and believers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.16, 19.20.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, there is a ſpiritual union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all believers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. ſuch an union hath believers with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. and through Chriſt with God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. <hi>with Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is an union of believers with God, beyond all theſe, moſt ſpiritual, moſt myſtical, and as yet incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: ſuch an union as is made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the union between the Father and his Son, <hi>John</hi> 14.20. <hi>and John</hi> 17.21, 22.</p>
               <p>This union of believers is not the ſame for quality or equality with that of the Father and Son; nor is this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to refemble the natural union of the Father and Son in the Godhead. But that myſtical union between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, in our fleſh, carrying on with joynt hand and heart the great work of Redemption; ſo 'tis expreſs'd, <hi>John</hi> 10.28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From this union flows our Communion with God which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Believers have a ſpecial ſpiritual
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59234:7"/>Communion with God: Communion is between perſons ſome way or other u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, participating of each others good things for their comfort and delight: Believers by union with God, have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God.</p>
               <p n="1">i. They have Communion with God in nature, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.4. not by way of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, as if God divided his nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us; nor by way of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as if God emptied of his nature into ours, but by way of Communion.</p>
               <p>As the humane nature of Chriſt, was aſſumed into unity with the Divine in the Perſon of his Son, and by that union had Communion with the divine nature, whence followed an Unction, whereby the humane nature received Perfections and Excellencies above its own natural capacity; ſo by Communion with the divine nature, we receive an unction from the Holy One, the Spirit, and its ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Excellencies and Perfections.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they have Communion with God in all the divine Relations in the Godhead, Father, Son, and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59234:7"/>Father, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.31. Son, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 19. Holy Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 14.17.—<hi>Hedwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they have Communion with all three Perſons in their peculiar and diſtinct Excellencies.</p>
               <p>The peculiar Excellency of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Love, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.16. of the Son is Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.24. Of the Spirit is comfort, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16.

               <p>IN the firſt Point I opened the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Believers Communion with God. The ſecond is the bond of this Communion, <hi>The Love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>The Love of God is a ſweet, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59234:11"/>bond of inſeparable Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and believers.</hi> Though the love of God in Scripture ſomtimes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies our love to God, yet here it muſt needs ſignifie Gods love to us, for not our love to God, but his love to us is the only foundation on which a believer can build ſuch high reſolution, ſtrong confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, glorious joy, triumphing faith, as is in the text. There is a threefold love of God to us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a general love, a love of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, or good will, common to all his creatures, as they are the works of his hand, ſo his mercy and love are over all his works; the inviſible things of his Wiſdom and Power are ſeen in every creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. And what of God is in any creature is lovely, and he loves every thing himſelf hath made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a particular love, a love of beneficence or bounty: Thus he loves man above all his other creatures before his fall, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.31. After his fall, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59234:11"/>
               <p>Thirdly, a more ſpecial and peculiar love, a love of Communion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency; it is of ſuch out of mankind, whom God hath loved in Chriſt, with an everlaſting love: theſe are believers according to Election.</p>
               <p>Man is Partaker with other creatures of all that love of God that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to them, yet hath a ſpecial love of God that communicates to him, and no other creature hath part with him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers partake of all that love of God that communicates it ſelf to all other creatures, and to all other men: yet hath a ſpecial love of God, in which no other creature, and no other men, partake with him. Thus a believer is Heir of all that love that ever iſſued forth from God, of this love of God the Text ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is the bond of our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being that which draws us into this Communion.</p>
               <p>There is in every man by nature an unwillingneſs to come to God, a drawing off from God, and Communion with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59234:12"/>him. Partly, from ſin and corruption which is in man, which is a privation of our ſuitableneſs and likeneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God, and is a poſitive contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and oppoſition to God, both which are flatly repugnant to Communion; and partly alſo from the apprehenſion of the wrath and diſpleaſure of God, and our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſneſs to his Iuſtice whom moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly and injuriouſly we have offended, hence no man will come into Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God except drawn, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44.</p>
               <p>But what then, doth God compell men againſt their wills? no, this would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that natural principle of liberty God hath implanted in that faculty, therfore in infinit wiſdom he hath order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring them in, by a way of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſs and free obedience, and the meanes by which the power of his grace ſhall produce effectually thoſe effects in the hearts of men, to which they ſhall freely and willingly conſent to, is a way of love; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11: 4. Love is the cord that drawes men, that drawes man into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59234:12"/>with God <hi>Ier:</hi> 34.3. When God by his Spirit manifeſts his love to the ſoul, whom no other meanes could perſwade much leſs compel, the ſoul is conquered by the ſecret, ineffable potency and Tweetneſs of the operation of love, love drawes and the ſoule comes, yea, runs into his armes, yea, into that boſom where love opens, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.1.4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is the bond of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, becauſe it binds God faſt to us, and us faſt to God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it binds God faſt to us, in this ſacred communion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this it doth by bringing us into an everlaſting Covenant with God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.3. No after-ſins, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, this is that doth diſpenſe all the bleſſings of the Covenant to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this Communion.</p>
               <p>This love of God is that which firſt gives forth Jeſus Chriſt to them, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.10. And with Chriſt all other graces, and Priviledges of grace that concur to ſalvation, <hi>Tit</hi> 3.4, 7.</p>
               <p>This love makes the firſt great change and alteration in mens eſtates and conditions, <hi>v.</hi> 3. this love of God goes on to manifeſt it ſelf to ſuch in Chriſt, in the Renovation of the Spirit, in Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in making us heirs of glory and eternal life. So love the Fountain of all grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 4, 5, 6. ſee 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. the love whence flows all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as from the original, is there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirmed of God the Father.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is the bond of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as it binds us faſt to God; this it doth,</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59234:13"/>
               <p>Firſt, by engaging us to believe in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God o loved, &amp;c.</hi> the love of God here is made matter of greateſt encouragement to finners, to believe againſt all doubts of ſtrongeſt engagement, to believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Pleas, Pretences on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</p>
               <p>

               <p>Gods love with a <hi>So,</hi> ſwallows up all our ſins, doubts, fears, difficulties, wants, weakneſſes unworthineſſes or whatever ſtands in the way of believing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by enabling us to believe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. We have known ſuch whom no means, no Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, no Perſuaſions could prevail with to believe, if God make known but a ſecret hint of his love, forthwith it believes againſt all unbelief, believes in hope, againſt hope, and gives glory to God.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59234:14"/>
               <p>Faith is called the Gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. and every gift ſprings from love; Chriſt is the Gift of God, love and faith is the gift of Gods love; the love of God brings Chriſt and faith together, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites both together.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by begeting in our hearts a love to God in ſome manner of Analogie like that of his to us.</p>
               <p>Love begets love, as fire begets fire, and in this flame the ſoul, like <hi>Manoahs</hi> Angel, aſcends up to God in heaven; it is a common proverb, that love alwayes deſcends, ſeldome aſcends; It is not ſo between God and beleivers, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4: 19. and that love which aſcends from us to God, what is it but that which firſt deſcended from God to us.</p>
               <p>A woman that hath no love, no affection for ſuch a perſon, nor any thoughts of him, it may be never ſaw him, yet when ſuch a perſon comes to make known his true love and affection to her, it preſently begets love in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſo— Thus the Apoſtle doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it, <hi>Eph</hi> 1.4. ſee how it begins in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59234:14"/>the love of God to us, and ends in our love to him; this is that the eternal love of God aimed at, and works up every believer to; God loves that he may be loved.</p>
               <p>Where God loves, he takes up his reſt in that ſoul, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. where the ſoul lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s God, it takes up its reſt in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. and values the love of God above richeſt enjoyments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. Now it cannot live, but in the love of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by actuating the whole foul in a way of ſervice and ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God. What the Apoſtle ſaith of the love of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. the ſame is true of the love of God, it conſtrains, it beſiegeth, it hemms us in, it takes full poſſeſſion of the ſoul, brings it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the regency of divine love, is wholly at the Command of love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. This is the love of God.— Herein is Gods love manifeſted to be ſpecial love to us, and herein is our love manifeſted to be ſincere love to him: This is the ſpirit in the wheels that moves all the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59234:15"/>faculties and affections of the ſoul to God in a way of duty and obedience.</p>
               <p>In this way God manifeſts his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of love with us, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.23. and we manifeſt our Communion of love with God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. To walk in the light, is to walk in a way of holineſs and holy obedience to God, and whereas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny failings and fallings ſhort will be found in the beſt obedience, yet there is a remedy provided, the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Uſe.</hi> This point leads us to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt ſpring, the higheſt original of grace and glory to believers, and that is the love of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the love of Chriſt as Mediator, but the love of God, whence Chriſt and all ſpiritual bleſſings with him originally flow to us.</p>
               <p>In vain ſhall we ſeek for any other motive to God in his diſpenſations of grace to us, beſides his love, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.7, 8.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Uſe.</hi> Is love the bond of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then it is a very near, cloſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Communion. Love is a tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimation, one ſoul in another, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1. or with another; it is a believer engraven in Gods heart, appled in Gods eye, carried up and down in Gods armes, like a beloved diſciple, lying in Gods Boſom, the Place, the Seat, the Center of love.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is of love therefore a choice Communion; Love ſingles out its object; it looks upon many, chuſeth few, the children of his love are a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen generation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9</p>

               <p>This love of God, as it was the only moving cauſe to God, of the eternal
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59234:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>purpoſe of his grace, concerning us; ſo it is the chief Agent and principal Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of all grace in us, as we declared in the laſt Point.</p>
               <p>Yet we muſt conſider, the only <hi>Medium</hi> or means by which God doth manifeſt his love to us, through which he doth diſpence all the effects of his eternal love and grace to us, is Jeſus Chriſt, who is appointed of God to be the only Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of all his Decrees of love and grace, and is ordained to come in as Mediatour, in all things between God and us.</p>
               <p>This I ſhall endeavour to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was anointed with all that love which God the Father had taken up in his own boſom, to be laid out on all his elect ones; and thus he became Son and Heir of all the love of God to his beloved.</p>

By the glory of God we are in a ſpecial manner to underſtand it, of the glory of his eternal love and grace; if with this we compare, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. and 12. every believers experience will bear witneſs to this truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Dem.</hi> God did firſt accompliſh all that grace in Chriſt, which his eternal love had purpoſed to perform in us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. Hence Chriſt became the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. the firſt-fruits, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. The Image, Patern, and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar of all the grace and glory of God to us.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59234:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. Our ſalvation was founded on the eternal Election of God; Chriſt was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. He was not only one choſen out of all Creatures, Men and Angels, but choſen out of all the three Perſons in Trinity, to be the Mediatour of our Peace; by the Election of Chriſt ours is ratified and confirmed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, our ſalvation includes in it a Predeſtination to the Adoption; We were ordained to be ſons of God.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt in our nature, by its perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Union with the Divine, was the Son of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.45. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our ſalvation is carried on by our Calling; Ieſus Chriſt had his Call of God to all the Offices that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him in the Work of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, our ſalvation is carried by Iuſtification; ſo Chriſt was firſt juſtified, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>Fiſthly, our ſalvation is carried on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a final victory over all our enemies, for Chriſt Ieſus he hath firſt overcome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59234:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Sixthly, our ſalvation is perfected by the Reſurrection from the dead, and a poſſeſſion of glory; for Chriſt firſt roſe from the dead, and entred into his glory, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5, 6.</p>
               <p>So what faith, hope, love, holineſs, patience, humility, obedience God ſhould require of us, was firſt performed by Chriſt who became a Pattern, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amplar of all grace, unto obedience for us, <hi>John</hi> 15.10. and our conſtant Growth and Increaſe in Grace, is called a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in all things to Chriſt our Head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Dem.</hi> All theſe treaſures of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which God hath in his eternal love decreed to lay out on his Elect, both in grace and glory, are given into Chriſt, <hi>Col</hi> 1.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. Chriſt Heir of all things by appointment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Here he is ſaid to be made of God unto us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God intended to make our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on compleat by, <hi>viz.</hi> Wiſdom,—1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption. Theſe four Ingredients are perfect and compleat ſalvation. So
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59234:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>that of Chriſts fulneſs we ſtill receive grace for grace, and glory for glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>John</hi> 1.16. and our compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, 10.</p>
               <p>Hence Chriſt is ſaid to be not only given us for a Saviour, but to be the ſalvation of God to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.30. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he contains in himſelf the whole matter of our ſalvation, every part and parcel that makes our ſalvation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Dem.</hi> When God actually performs any of that grace his eternal love purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and decreed for us; he firſt makes us to be in Chriſt, makes us one with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Of God are ye in Chriſt Ieſus, — he gathers into one in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10, he calls them into the fellowſhip of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. whom he intends to ſave.</p>
               <p>As we are ſaid to be choſen in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. ſo we are ſaid to be made the ſons of God in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. to be made the righteouſneſs of God in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> to be made new creatures in him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59234:19"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. to be made an habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> to be ſanctified, preſerved, called in Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Iude</hi> 1. hence we are called the Workmanſhip of God in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>The grounds of this truth, why God ſhould make out all the manifeſtations and diſpenſations of his love to us in Chriſt Ieſus may be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt only is that among all three Perſons in Trinity which God did ordain us to be, <hi>viz.</hi> the Son of God. The grace of our Adoption is the ſupreme Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all that grace we receive from Gods love, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.1. and is our Right and Title to all other bleſſings, if ſons then heirs. We muſt be ſons before we can have right to any part of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt having this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive peculiar to himſelf to be the Son of God, it was neceſſary that we ſhould be made the ſons of God in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59234:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe Chriſt was; as the only begotten Son of God, ſo the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the Father, ſole Heir of all his Fathers love, and his Fathers bleſſings, both in grace and glory. Therefore it behoved, that the manifeſtations of the Fathers love, and the diſpenſations of his love to us, in the bleſſings of grace and glory, ſhould be made in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the glory of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might not be communicated in any part to the creature, but to God alone, of whom, through whom, to whom are all things, to whom be glory for ever.</p>
               <p>It is God, who of himſelf, and in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by himſelf worketh all grace in us; of himſelf as the Father, in himſelf as the Son, by himſelf as the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>The Uſes of this Point are,</p>
               <p n="1">I. For Information.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it informs us how miſerable men are who are yet out of Chriſt, they are in no capacity to receive one token of Gods ſaving love.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59234:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>They may love themſelves, and do good to themſelves; the world may love, friends may love them and ſhew them love, but God will ſhew them no love, out of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it informs us of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent order and method the Wiſdom of God hath obſerved in ſtating our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The love of God, which is the great ſpring of life and grace, is firſt in God himſelf as the original.</p>
               <p>Then it is in Chriſt as he to whom belongs the Birth-right, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of it, in whom all the Promiſes of God are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then it is in us, who are in Chriſt Ieſus, in whom we are made Partakers of the righteouſneſs, holineſs, and glory of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that no natural goodneſs in our ſelves, nothing we can do in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law of God, no external duties of Worſhip to God, no moral Righteouſneſs towards man, can be the leaſt part of that Righteouſneſs that can bring us into a ſtate of love and favour with God.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59234:21"/>
               <p>It muſt be what God doth beſtow on us in Ieſus Chriſt, for no man is made that unto which the love of God hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated him, in himſelf, and through himſelf, but in and through Chriſt only.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it informs us in what glaſs we may moſt clearly behold the love of God to us in all its effects; it is Ieſus Chriſt. Would we know the love of God to us, look upon his love to Chriſt, or know the dignity of our Adoption; look upon the Sonſhip of Chriſt, or know the dignity of our Iuſtification: look upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, or know the glory God intends us.</p>
               <p>Many things that concern our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have yet no other ſubſiſting in us, but what ſaith giveth them, which yet are actually accompliſht in Chriſt, they, are in us yet imperfect, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it informs, firſt, of the infinite lovelineſs,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Chriſt, who had all the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings out of divine love on him, all the love of God that was due to himſelf and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59234:21"/>to all the Saints beſides.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the infinite capacity of Chriſts Perſon, who can contain in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all the love, and all the Priviledges of the love of God to all his Elect, both in grace and glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the infinite love of Chriſt to us, in being willing to impart to us a ſhare of that love of God, that grace and glory of God that was only due to him, in the right of the firſt and only begotten.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Uſe.</hi> For inſtruction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we go to God for any manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his love, or any diſpenſation of love, in any ſpiritual or heavenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings go out of your ſelves, get into Chriſt, in him alone we can know his love and receive the bleſſings of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nothing comes to us immediately from God, but mediately in and through Chriſt, who is Mediatour between God and us in all things divine have hath decreed for us</p>
               <p>Secondly, how much doth it concern us, a mong the higheſt and chiefell concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſalvation to have our union with Chriſt, our intereſt in Chriſt cleared up.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59234:22"/>
               <p>There only we can know what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love purpoſed for us from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what it hath done for us, what it hath further to beſtow upon us, how it is forming and faſhioning us by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, into a bleſſed Conformity with the Son of God in grace and glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let this teach us how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt our love to God, how to return our love to God in faith, and all the duties of our worſhip and obedience; after the manner of all the diſpenſations of Gods love to us; that is, do all to God in and through Ieſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Uſe.</hi> In point of Conſolation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Admirable comfort to be loved of God, with any kind of love is ſweet, but to be loved of God in Chriſt, to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as Chriſt, this excelleth.</p>
               <p>To have fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſufferings, afflictions, reproaches is great honour; but to have fellowſhip with Chriſt in the love of God, and all the wonderful effects of it; This is to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59234:22"/>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> great Lord;</hi> Chriſt is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59234:23"/>in a twofold capacity, as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, and as God-Man or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; In both reſpects he is a Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As he is the only begotten Son of God, by eternal generation. So he is Lord of the whole Creation of God; all things have their being and ſuſtentation of him, <hi>Col.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Image, the firſt-born, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. The firſt-born in Scripture notes Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, Lordſhip and Dominion: the firſt-born is Heir of all, and the Heir is called Lord of all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. From this his Primogeniture the Apoſtle inferreth his Lordſhip, or Dominion over the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as he is Mediatour, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſo he is Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By Ordination or Conſtitution, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Him hath God appointed</hi> — See that <hi>John</hi> 3.35.</p>
               <p>The Man Chriſt is made Lord of all, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.26. He hath this Lordſhip by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from the Father: he hath it by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>John</hi> 5.22. He hath committed all Judgment to him; by Judgement
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59234:23"/>here we are to underſtand an abſolute dominion and ſovereignty over all things and all perſons in heaven, earth and hell, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. Hence we have the four beaſts with twenty four Elders, with the Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Thus the Man Chriſt is ſaid to be made higher then the Kings of the earth, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 89.27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by Unction, he is anointed with the power of a Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. and this power is univerſal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. And he is anointed with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wiſdom, and that Wiſdom is proportionable to his Power; that all Power, and this all Wiſdom, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>By both theſe he is throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht for the adminiſtration of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which belongs to him as Lord: Power to protect, Wiſdom to govern all his ſubjects and ſervants, Power to cruſh, Wiſdom to defeat all the counſels of his enemies.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59234:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Power able by weakneſs to confound things that are mighty; and Wiſdome, able by fooliſhneſs to bring to nought the underſtanding of the Prudent, and both theſe anointed with Righteouſneſs, the ſtability of every Kingdom, and the Perpetuity of Chriſts. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by Conqueſt and Victory; he hath overcome all his enemies; he hath overcome the ſtrong man, Satan, taken away his Armour, divided the ſpoils of that Kingdom of darkneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. he hath overcome the wrath of God, the ſeverity of his Juſtice, the Malediction of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 13. He hath bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tted out—ſpoiled Principalities, — <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.31. He hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com ſin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. He hath overcome the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.24. He hath aboliſht death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to conſider Jeſus Chriſt as the Lord of his Church, Lord of all believers, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18.—that he might have the Preeminence or Lordſhip; All believers acknowledge him to be their Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. when they firſt receive
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59234:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>him by ſaith, they receive him as a Lord, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>Thus the Angels preach'd him to the faith of men, when he was firſt-born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.11. Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preach'd him, when they exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the ſaith of the world by the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 30.</p>
               <p>Every particular believer may ſay of Chriſt. as <hi>David, My Lord, Pſal.</hi> 110. 1. and as <hi>Thomas, John</hi> 10.28.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider what the nature and quality of Chriſts Dominion or Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over believers is, and then how it is exerciſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The quality of Chriſts dominion of Lordſhip over believers, and his whole Church, is a dominion of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. a Kingdom of righteouſneſs and grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. Grace hath reigned through Righteouſneſs by Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is exerciſed in a way of grace, he is called a gracious Lord, 1 <hi>Pot.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by converting their ſouls, by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59234:25"/>pulling down the ſtrong holds of ſin and Satan in their Conſciences; by caſting down the imaginations — and bringing them into ſubjection, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. This he doth Miniſterially, by the Word of Reconciliation effectually, by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Thus being delivered from the power of darkneſs, they are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Kingdom of Gods dear Son, and Chriſt is become their Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is the only Lord of their ſaith, as he is Authour of it, — <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, To him only we can ſay, as that poor man, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;</hi> as the diſciples, <hi>Lord, increaſe our ſaith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he only is the object or matter of our faith; the Apoſtle preach'd him the only Lord, our faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. It is higheſt ſacriledge, horrible uſurpation, to impoſe any thing to be believed for ſalvation, which Chriſt hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he is Lord by juſtifying their perſons, and forgiving their ſins: he is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59234:25"/>called the Lord our Righteouſneſs, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.6. He is to us a <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> a King of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.2. To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſin is Royalty, the Prerogative of ſuch a Perſon, who hath dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, as a Prince and Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by ruling. leading, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them whom he hath juſtified and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. This he doth by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Laws in their hearts, by giving a ſpiritual underſtanding in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Will, by forming and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioning their affections and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into holy obedience, to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpiritual nature of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</p>
               <p>Fifthly, by affording all needful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to all their wants, by affording mercy and grace to help: — <hi>Joſeph</hi> was made Lord of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he had all the Granaries and Store-houſes at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to diſpence.—So Chriſt is Lord of all his Fathers Treaſures, and he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all things, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59234:26"/>
               <p>Sixthly, in protecting, upholding, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring them in all their dangers, amidſt all their temptations, infirmities, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. by his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions pltying them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and grace helping them, by his care and wiſdom proportioning their ſtrength to their trials; to him every believer may ſay, <hi>Lord, ſave me, or I periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, in overcoming all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their ſalvation, the two Heads or Generals whereof are Satan, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20 and Antichriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14</p>
               <p>Eighthly, he hath manifeſted himſelf to be our Lord, when he died for us, and roſe for us, and ſate down at the right hand of God for us, and hath quickned us together, and raiſed us together, and ſet us together with himſelf in heavenly places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 25 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider how much this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that Chriſt leſus is our Lord, doth afford to this triumph, or ful perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, that nothing can ſeparate us from the love of God.</p>
               <p>He is our Lord, and Lord over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59234:26"/>in Heaven, Earth and Hell; Lord over Angels, Men, Devils; Lord over Life and Death; Lord over all Prinei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers; Lord in the heighths and Lord in the depths; Lord over things preſent, and Lord over things to come; ſuch as have a Lord, ſo full of Love, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Wiſdom, Compaſſions, Grace, can never fall from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Uſe.</hi> Is Chriſt Ieſus a Lord over all creatures; here is encouragement for any poor creature that lies under the ſenſe of ſin and wrath, to come to Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>Lord ſave me, or I muſt periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth the wrath of God threaten thee, run to Chriſt, and ſay, be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Doſt thou feel a dominion of ſin, a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of prevalling luſts, leading the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, come and ſay, Lord, many lores have dominion over me, O let me be under the Dominion and Government of thy grace.</p>
               <p>Doth Satan purſue, Conſcie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce accuſe,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59234:27"/>Law condemn, Death threaten, Hell open upon thee; Come to Chriſt who hath ſpoiled Satan, pacified Conſcience, ſatisfied Law, aboliſht death, triumph'd over Hell, he is <hi>Lord</hi> over all, hath ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up all in victory.</p>
               <p>Doſt thou want a Righteouſneſs to luſtifie thee, Chriſt is <hi>Lord</hi> of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: Doſt thou want Pardon of ſin, Chriſt is <hi>Lord</hi> and hath power to forgive ſin: Doſt thou want any grace within the whole compaſs of the Promiſes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; Treaſures of God, Chriſt is <hi>Lord</hi> of all; Doſt thou want a good title to Heaven, Chriſt is Prince of life, and Lord of Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Uſe.</hi> Is Chriſt Ieſus in a ſpecial manner, the <hi>Lord</hi> of his Church, the <hi>Lord</hi> of believers.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Let us own Ieſus Chriſt to be our <hi>Lord,</hi> for this end two things are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Faith; when the Apoſtle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents this Lord abſent to us; he ſaith, <hi>We walk by faith,</hi> — 2 Cor. 5, 6, 7. Other lords are preſent with us, to command,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59234:27"/>encourage, overſee, over rule, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us; Chriſt is abſent, therefore to ſtand in awe of him, to be diligent in his Work, to do, to ſuffer for him, to fear to offend him, to endeavor that whether preſent or abſent we may be accepted of him: this requires much faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. <hi>It is not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord:</hi> Many that live under the Education and external Profeſſion of the Goſpel in words, call Chriſt, Lord: yet they will never yield up themſelves in obedience to him, as their Lord, without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling grace, and power of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As ye have received Chriſt Ieſus the Lord, ſo walk in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 6.2. Give up your ſelves, conſciences, thoughts, deſires, the ſecrets of your ſouls, and the converſations of your lives to be guided, ordered, governed by his Word and Will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, honour Chriſt Ieſus your Lord both in life and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 7.8, 9.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59234:28"/>
               <p>Fourthly, let us be faithful, ſincere, conſtant and abundant in his ſervice, we have a Lord that can and will reward us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, if Chriſt Ieſus be our Lord, let us truſt him, and live in dependance upon him for our preſent ſubſiſtence and future expectations; the Lord never failed them that waited on him.</p>

               <p>THE Apoſtle having taken himſelf and all believers to their ſtrong holds, which is Communion with God, and having ſtrengthned this Communion with God by love, and fortified this love of God in Chriſt Ieſus; and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged Chriſt Ieſus his Lord, his Leader, the Captain of our ſalvation. Now he prepares for the encounter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He takes a view of all his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and then encourageth his faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59234:28"/>them all, <hi>I am Perſwaded.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Expects an aſſault from all kind of enemies; Satan muſtering his Aemies from the four quarters of Heaven, Earth and Hell, compaſſing the Camp of the Saints, endeavoring to overthrew the beloved City, the ſtrong hold of Gods beloved ones; he muſters death and life.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>Such as are beloved of God in Chriſt Ieſus may, yea, muſt expect to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all kinds of enemies, or evils poſſible or imaginable in this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. In theſe enemies the Apoſtle reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons up in the Text, which befal Saints on the Account of Gods love to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, conſider the reality of them, they are all things which have a true, real being and ſubſiſtence; there is life, and there is death.—</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle doth not fight with his own ſhadow, or in fighting only beat the Air; he doth not propound to himſelf or us, dangers, evils, enemies, which have only a notional, aiery empty exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but ſuch as have a real ſolid being:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59234:29"/>not one of them but believers may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to encounter with, at one time or other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the multitude of them; the Apoſtle reckons up but the chief Heads, Leaders and Commanders of theſe evils, enemies and dangers, eight in number, Death, Life, &amp;c. How many Armies of dangers, evils, enemies, may march under the Conduct of every one of theſe Commanders are innumerable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. how many under death, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny under life, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the variety of them, they are of divers kinds; ſome ariſe from life, ſome from death.</p>
               <p>They are managed by variety of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents and Inſtruments, ſome by Angels good and bad: ſome by Principalities and Powers.—</p>
               <p>They are inflicted at divers times: ſome from the preſent, ſome from the future.</p>
               <p>They come from divers places, ſome from the heighth, ſome from the depth.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59234:29"/>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſtrange contrariety in them; Death is oppoſite to life, good Angels to bad, the Principalities and Powers of the World, oppoſite to one another; things preſent oppoſite: to things to come, heighths to depths. Here is <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſch,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſch</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iudah;</hi> here is <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> at variance between themſelves, but both againſt Chriſt; from theſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite intereſts ariſe dangers to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and how contrary ſoever each to other, yet they all one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endanger the ſalvation of Saints, and moſt of them vigorouſly endeavor and deſign their deſtruction to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the evils, afflictions which may befal them who are in the love of God. Little leſs the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had declared before, <hi>verſe</hi> 35, 36, 37. ſhould befal them upon the account of Chriſts love; which is, <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59234:30"/>
               <p>Here the world is muſtering up all its forces, and arming it ſelf with all the weapons of its indignation againſt them, who are loved of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>There are two evils which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made to comprehend all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in hell: The pain of loſs, and the pain of ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Both theſe in their kind may befal thoſe in this world, who are under the love of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Pain that ariſeth from loſs; loſs of all their outward comforts, deareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and ſweeteſt enjoyments of the world, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.28 29 what hath a man to loſe more. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the loſs of all</hi>—</p>
               <p>Secondly, Pain of ſenſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, 36.37. <hi>Tortured,</hi>—</p>
               <p>You ſay theſe were of the Church of the Old Teſtament: the New Teſtament Church hath greater Priviledges: No, compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.22. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36. the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the ſame words as the Prophet: as the words are the ſame, the conditions are the ſame, no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between that Church and this, and this in reſpect to afflictions: We are kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59234:31"/>all the day, not one day but every day; nor one part of the day, but all the day; though this ſlaughter do not befal every one in the Church every day; yet it is probable no day paſſeth wherein more or fewer are ſlain in one place or other; the Church ſuffereth every where in her Members, and every day, though every particular Member doth not. We are counted as ſheep, ſheep are killed to feed and to feaſt: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly world hunger and thirſt as much after the blood and fleſh of Saints, feed and feaſt on it with as much delight, as men do on ſlaughtered ſheep; hence that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to demonſtrate, that all the evils, afflictions, that Saints ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet in this world, either from God, or from the world, are upon the account of Gods love to them in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I All they ſuffer from God, or his more, immediate Inſtruments and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he hath loved them, all his chaſtiſements are from love, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59234:31"/>
               <p>Secondly, as they are from love, ſo they are for love, for the further manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods love to them, and for the ſtrengthning of their Communion with God in love, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.9.</p>
               <p n="1">I. All they ſuffer from the power and malice of Satan and the world, is upon the account of Gods love to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, either becauſe God loves them: there is an irreconcileable enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the world: God hates the world, and the world hates God, and all that God loves, and becauſe God loves them. Wherefore did <hi>Cain</hi> hate his brother? becauſe God ſhewed more love to <hi>Abel,</hi> in accepting his offering; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did <hi>Iſhmael</hi> perſecute <hi>Iſaac:</hi> becauſe God ſhewed more love to <hi>Iſaac:</hi> why did <hi>Eſau</hi> hate <hi>Iacob?</hi> becauſe God loved <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and —</p>
               <p>Secondly, or becauſe they love God more then the world; wherefore did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> perſecute <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he loved Chriſt, the reproaches of Chriſt, and the ſufferings of his people, above all prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pleaſures of ſin in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, or the rich treaſures of <hi>Egypt, Heb.</hi> 11, 24, 5, 6.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59234:32"/>
               <p>Thirdly or becauſe hereby they might bring them out of love, credit, favour with God, ſo much is imported, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. But they are never more in account with God, more in Gods love, then in and under the ſufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, or becauſe hereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to bring them out of love with God, and Chriſt, and the ways of God. So much ſeems to be implied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 87. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.20. No Courteſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s will oblige the ungedly, except the godly will leave doing good. The Grounds of this Point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To make all the Children conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his own Son, and all the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren conformable to their elder Brother, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.29. All our ſufferings and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are Chriſts Cup, it is one and the ſame Cup Chriſt and his diſciples drank of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.23. <hi>And Chriſt ſaith, Te ſhall indeed drink.</hi>— Now this Cup of Chriſt had in it not one or two only, but a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of many bitter ingredients.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to conr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m Saints in the faith of Gods love, and the love of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59234:32"/>Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. Conſider here,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Apoſtles did affirm concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afflictions, with the ſame certainty they preach'd the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they affirm not concerning a few, but many afflictions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they declare in ſome reſpect a neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this is the way that leads to Gods Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, hereby they confirm believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſtrengthen them to continue in the faith of Gods love.—</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to make full trial of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, conſtancy, ſtrength of our love to God, and to Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.7.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> had fully declared his love to Chriſt, then Chriſt tells him of his ſufferings for him, <hi>John</hi> 21.17, 18. Becauſe ſome pretend love to Chriſt, as the ſtony ground which gladly received the Goſpel, but when perſecution came fell away; Others who pretend love to Chriſt, can ſuffer in ſome kinds, but not in others; ſome can ſuffer a while, but not long; therefore God hath appointed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59234:33"/>many, great, of divers kinds, yea, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to the laſt; not only ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but ſome to come; to try the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our love to Chriſt to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Uſe.</hi> This Point convinceth the world, and the generality of men, who yet live within the ſound of the Goſpel, of groſs ignorance, miſapprehenſion.—</p>
               <p>They judge of the love of God, and the ways of God, as they are attended with outward peace, liberty, ſecurity from evils, en mies, dangers, by that worldly felicity that attends them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it reproves thoſe who are informed in this truth, and therefore dare not engage for God, cannot love the ways of God, becauſe they know they muſt thereby expoſe themſelves to ſo many kinds of ſufferings and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Moſt men love a dainty, nice, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Profeſſion; they can love Chriſt and his Priviledges, but not Chriſt and his ſufferings; they can like the love of God in Chriſt, but not the maniſeſtations
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59234:33"/>of that love through ſo many afflictions; theſe cry out, as the baſe Iews to Chriſt; <hi>Come thee down from the Croſs, and we will believe in thee, profeſs thee, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, for Exhortation to young Chriſtians, who are conſidering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting about giving themſelves up to Chriſt, and his ways, to take that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28, 31. to ſit down ſeriouſly, and conſider, what it will coſt you: to conſider, whether with our ten thouſand, (the Promiſes, Graces, Comforts, Priviledges, we have in the Goſpel) we can meet twenty thouſand, ſuch is the number of the afflictions, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, temptations, will encounter us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to thoſe who are engaged in the faith, love, Profeſſion of Chriſt; do not fancy to your ſelves ſome few, ſome ſmall. ſome kind of troubles, ſtate the condition aright, expect many and great, and of ſeveral kinds; all what is in the text.</p>
               <p>It is true for our comfort, all theſe in the text, are not commonly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59234:34"/>the portion of every Saint, but of the whole Church; and God divideth to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saint, as he ſees good. But it ſtands us in hand to prepare for every one, for the greateſt; men arm themſelves all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe they know not where the blow will light.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for Inſtruction; Judge not of your ſelves, nor other Chriſtians by the multitude, magnitude, and variety of the greateſt troubles that do befal you or them; they are all founded in the love of God to you in Chriſt Ieſus your Lord.</p>

               <p>THE Apoſtle having attained a full aſſurance of the love of God in Chriſt, he builds his ſtrong holds, fortifies his ſaith in that love, and then takes a view of all his enemies to the utmoſt, which might be ſuppoſed to endanger him, as

               <p>Doct. <hi>Such as have truly believed the Love of God in Chriſt Ieſus their Lord, may have a full Perſuaſion of faith they ſhall continue in the Communion of that love, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all enemies that ſhall attempt a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59234:35"/>
               <p>This I ſhall endeavor to demonſtrate,</p>
               <p>I From the nature of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, believers have with God in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a fellowſhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Son Chriſt Ieſus, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.2. In which obſerve, firſt the reality and certainty of this Communion: truly our Fellowſhip—</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Communion is a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge common to every believer, with the chiefeſt and higheſt Apoſtles, one of which was <hi>Iohn,</hi> called the beloved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, he whom Ieſus loved and laid in his boſom; yet— <hi>that ye might have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the effect that naturally flows from that Communion to believers, <hi>viz.</hi> fulneſs of joy, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Could any thing, did any thing ſeparate the Apoſtles from their Communion with the Father, and his Son Ieſus Chriſt; every believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Communion with the Father, and— is the ſame: Is there a moſt unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable truth and reality in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, whence ſlows fulneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59234:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>of joy to believers, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly none can ſeparate them from it: for then the joy would be very imperſect, narrow and ſcanty; and by reaſon of the uncertainty of it, the joy of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his Communion with God, would prove but like that ſpoken of, <hi>Iob</hi> 20.5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a Conjugal Fellowſhip and Communion be ween God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. It is for everlaſſing, never to be violated: it is performed with thoſe ſolemnities, ratified and confirmed by thoſe engagements, which make it ſure and inviolable.</p>
               <p>God undertakes for his part, and pawns his Righteouſneſs, his Iudgment, his loving kindneſs, his mercies, and his faith fulneſs for Performance: and he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes for our part, they ſhall know the Lord, and they that know the Lord, will never depart from him.</p>
               <p>He who faith of man and woman in Conjugal Communion he hates put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.16. will much leſs put away whom he hath betrothed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59234:36"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Dem.</hi> Is taken from God, in whom the love that flows from this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in, as its upper fountain and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: The love of God, the love which is in God. There are four things in God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Power of this God, engaged to keep his in cloſe Communion with himſelf, againſt all adverſe power that can attempt a ſeparation, <hi>John</hi> 10.29. If none can pluck them out of his hand, leſs can they pluck them out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. A man may have that wrung out of his hand by violence, which cannot be pluckt out of his heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the unchangeableneſs of God; a <hi>Balaam</hi> could ſee this, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. This fenced and fortified them there in Gods love, againſt all the ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and inchantments of their enemies. This alſo fenced and fortified them in Gods love againſt the greateſt provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by their own ſins, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8, 9. God loved <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Womb, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to love him through Old and New Teſtament, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59234:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Thirdly, the faithfulneſs of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Oath, by which they are fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and fortified in the love of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all their own backſlidings, and the ſevereſt diſpenſations of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30.—33. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, my loving kindneſs,— confirmed by Covenant and Oath, <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the All-ſufficiency of God, He is God of all grace, and hath called them,—he will ſettle them — 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. Thus they are fenced and fortified in Gods love againſt all their own wants, doubts, weakneſſes and imperfections.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Dem.</hi> Is taken from the nature and quality of the love of God to believers, as it is ſaid to be in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hence it will appear to be an everlaſting love, from eternity to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; the love of God was from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31 3. and the love of Chriſt is to everlaſting, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. Believers have full ſecurity for their continuance in Gods love, becauſe it is the love of God in Chriſt, who is to carry it on through all its paſſages,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59234:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>oppoſitions, ſeeming interruptions to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord Ieſus his love is a victorious love, it brings off believers more then Conquerours, over all things that can attempt or endanger a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 37. More then Conquerors; becauſe whenever they fight with any enemies for the prize the love of Chriſt, they always come off Conquerors, not wounded, nor wearied, nor diſcouraged, nor with any loſs; but they come off ſounder, ſtronger, holier, fuller of all grace, and more confirmed in the love of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the love of God in Chriſt is indelible; the perſons are engraven on his heart; it is invincible; they are engraven as a Seal on is Arm, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. you may as eaſily pluck out Chriſts heart, as pluck away believers from his love; ſhe is ſeal'd on his Arm, to ſhew that mighty Power Chriſt ſtill enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, to keep them in his love, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her infirmities, and to ſubdue
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59234:37"/>all the enemies that riſe up againſt her.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Dem.</hi> Is taken from this love of God, as it is ſcituated in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he is Son and Heir of all Gods love; and the Heir is Lord of all: Jeſus Chriſt is Lord of all his Fathers love, and the love of God the Father is primarily his portion and inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>Now this Jeſus Chriſt is our Lord, ſo that what he poſſeſſeth of Gods love is ours, and upon what terms he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it. It is for us, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17, 23, 26. Now who can diſpoſſeſs Chriſt Jeſus of Gods love, or ſeparate him from the love of God No more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, is Protection to itſelf, and all that are under it, againſt the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all its enemies, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.4.— his Banner over me was love. Where the colours is, there is the Captain; where the Standard or Banner is, there is the King.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59234:38"/>The love of God in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, is as a banner diſplayed in the heart; and a believer may ſay of all the enemies reckoned in the Tex, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9, 10 — for <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God is with us, Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt Ieſus our Lord will make believers invincible in the love of God, what is the power of all theſe enemies in the Text to the power of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; he will bring them under believers feet, and make them know he hath loved them, and they ſhall never ſeparate them from his love, <hi>Rev</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Dem.</hi> Is taken from the nature and quality of that love of God which is in the hearts of believers, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the love of God to us in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is more ſweetneſs in the love of Chriſt, then bitterneſs in all the ſorrows, troubles, afflictions, that be fal them for the love of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſeven years ſervitude, ſeemed nothing to him for his love to <hi>Rachel,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59234:38"/>Gen.</hi> 29.20. The love of Chriſt is ſaid to be better then wine, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2, 4. Wine makes glad the heart, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.7. it makes a man neither to feel nor remember his ſorrows: the love of Chriſt in the foul makes every bitter thing ſweet, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can kill the love of Chriſt in the heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this love of Chriſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers hath a mighty potency in it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. ſtronger to keep us to Chriſt, then all adverſe power to ſeparate us from him.</p>
               <p>It conquers death, that conquers all other things; it ſwallows up the grave, that ſwallows up all things; conſumes coals of fire, which conſumes all things, and many waters,—<hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that love by which believers love God, as firſt loved of him, dwell in God, who then can ſeparate, — 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Dem.</hi> Is taken from the impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of all things that encounter a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, fortified in Gods love, how mighty ſoever in themſelves and in other Caſes,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59234:39"/>yet in this attempt they are impotent <hi>They are not able,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>to ſep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi>—</p>
               <p>So that if we ſhall conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of Saints Communion with God, and of that God in whom this love is, as in its original, and the nature of it, as in Chriſt Ieſus, as in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, and the nature and quality of it, as it is in believers, then we may conclude the Point in hand.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Thirdly, though all believers have the ſame Communion with God and Chriſt Ieſus in love, (as hath been declared) all

               <p>Fourthly, no believers ſecurity is founded on the Perſuaſion of his faith, but the Perſuaſion of his faith is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the love of God, which is in Chriſt Ieſus his Lord.</p>
               <p>A believer ſins, this weakens his faith; he gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, death is the puniſhment Gods Iuſtice, every way fitted and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to ſin: <hi>In the day thou eateſt, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> do againſt God, ſo death includes in it all the evils, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, miſeries, the wrath of God can bring upon the creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Power of Death was committed to the Devil: hence the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of believers under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, were all their life kept in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage through ſlaviſh fears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, death is a thing can no more have Communion with God then ſin can; ſin is abſolute oppoſition to Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and purity. Death is abſolute oppoſition to Gods life and being: he is called the living God, who is eternal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, immortal.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, death is attended with Hell in its firſt inſtitution, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.8. which is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59234:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>everlaſting ſeparation from God.</p>
               <p>By ſin the creature ſeparated it ſelf from Go, and its puniſhment was, to be everlaſtingly ſeparated from God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Saints of God have migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily cried out to God, when they have been in danger to be ſeparated from God by death, <hi>Heman, Pſal.</hi> 88.3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116.3.4 But death can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeparate a believer from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in love, through Chriſt leſus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the love of God, and the love of Chriſt never dies; Death could not aboliſh Chriſts love to believers, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.1. nor can it aboliſh the love of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12 11. The love of Chriſt to believers, and their love to him, is ſtrong as death—<hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. they never encountred death, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Saints have walked in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alley of the ſhadows of death, and have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59234:42"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt hath taken the Power of Death out of Satans hand, and taken it into his own hands, and commanded his people to fear not, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt hath executed that revenge threatned, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. againſt Death and the Grave, for all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, fears, temptations, cruelties, it hath executed againſt him and his holy Saints.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt hath aboliſht death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>s, to make weak and uſeleſs, to take away all the power and ſtrength of a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> death is not now, as it was; its ſting is gone; Boys play with a Bee when the ſting is out: Nor only ſo, but Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath brought in the room of it Life and Immortality; hence that <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Saints now die like Chriſt, though in the Grave, his ſoul was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from his body, yet neither was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Godhead.</p>
               <p>Though death may ſeparate between ſoul and body in a Saint, it cannot ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59234:42"/>either from Communion with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, death to Saints ſtrengthens their Communion with God, it ſeparates an holy Saint from a filthy world, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit from vile fleſh; Death to Saints ſeparates only the precious from the vile, whereby they come into more intimate Communion with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, it is not to believers, Death and Hell follows it, but Death and Heaven follows it: Death is ſo far from ſeparating, it carries the ſoul into the full enjoyment of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us conſider, how far a Chriſtian may be endangered by life; Here conſider four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the many errors, ſlips, falls, backſlidings, believers are ſubject to in this life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>James</hi> 5.19, 20. if any of you erre in judgement or practice.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:59234:43"/>
               <p>How much by theſe things a believer is endangered to a ſeparation from the love of God, and his Communion with God, appears <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.38. 2 <hi>Pat.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are endangered in this life, by the corrupt cuſtomes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of the ungodly, with whom they converſe in the world; how apt Gods people are to this, appears by that exhortation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. How much they are endangered thereby. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.36. what great Apoſtacies falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Thirdly, they are endangered by the profits, pleaſures, promiſes and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world: By theſe <hi>Demas</hi> was brought off from his fellowſhip in the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. Hence that, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.10.11.</p>
               <p>How much hereby they are endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fall from the love of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15.</p>

               <p>Firſt, ſome by Angels, Principalities and Powers, underſtand the whole Hoſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59234:46"/>of good Angels, diſtinguiſht by their orders, degrees and dignities as <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. The good Angels are called Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers.</p>

               <p>Dect. The Point is. <hi>That neither An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who are the Powers and Principalitie of Heaven, nor men, who are the Powers and Principalities of this world, nor Devils wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59234:46"/>are the Powers and Principalities of Hell, ſhall ever be able to ſeparate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall conſider the firſt particular, touching Angels.</p>
               <p>Firſt, why the Apoſtle ranketh good Angels among them who attempt or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger to ſeparate— ſeeing there is no cauſe of fear, or real danger from them in ſuch a cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe I anſwer, firſt, the good Angels ſtand not by their own ſtrength, if leſt to themſelves; and the frai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty of their own nature, they might fall from their preſent ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, become Apoſtates, and turn as bad enemies to believers, as Devils are.</p>
               <p>Their ſtability and unchangeableneſs, is not from any natural power of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grace in themſelves. The Apoſtle here ſpeaks by ſuproſition, not as if the good Angels would really at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do it, but if they ſhould they could not. It is like that ſpeech, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If an Angel—</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:59234:47"/>
               <p>Saints in the height of their ſaith and confidence of ſecurity in God, have ſuppoſed ſuch dangers as never were like to be, and triumphed over them as if they had really been, <hi>Pſal</hi> 46.1.—4.</p>
               <p>This wonderfully magnifies the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Saints in Gods love, that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, real or imaginary, poſſible or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uppoſed dangers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle holds forth the greateſt Hyperbole of faith, the Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſoul wrapt up in Gods love, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and beyond every creature of the higheſt Perfection. Therefore he takes in the latitude of the whole creature, that is below God himſelf, not only men and devils, but even the Angels, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over them in this Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtle here ſpeaks, as a man going into the field to meet his enemie, who in the height of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, in the confidence of his ſtrength and skill in his weapon, bids his enemy chuſe his Weapon, chuſe his Ground, chuſe his Second to his beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:59234:47"/>
               <p>So the Apoſtle arm'd with Gods love, encloſed in Gods boſom, and confident nothing ſhall ſeparate him, bids his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in this cauſe, chuſe his Weapon, Life or death; Chuſe his Ground, Earth, Hell or Heaven; chuſe his Second, Men or Devils, or the whole Hoſt of Angels, if theſe ſhall appear againſt him, he fears not to encounter them, be doubts not of victory over them.</p>
               <p>By this the Apoſtle would hold forth the immediate way of Saints, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in love, without the leaſt help or aſſiſtance of any creature concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Even all the Angels had nothing to do in it.</p>
               <p>And as no Angel could ever procure Gods love, or bring a Saint into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, ſo none ſhall be able to ſeparate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to conſider, how the good Angels may be ſuppoſed to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger believers in their Communion with God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The good Angels by their continual Attendance and Watchfulneſs about
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59234:48"/>Saints, muſt needs be privy to all their open ſins, in words, actions, duties, and cannot but conceive a holy indignation at the unworthy or unbeſeeming carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of believers, as that text, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11.10. ſhews. Saints miſcarriages and ſins grieve, offend the Angels, and hereby may be ſuppoſed to endanger their ſtate in Gods love, when they ſin againſt love.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Angels in zeal to God glory, are always in a readineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injuries that are done againſt God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.4 and they have ofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, the Angels are made ſervan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59234:48"/>but in Chriſt he is now exalted to glory and honour above the Angels; Chriſt hath not taken— <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is exalted in the Perſon of Chriſt, far above all Principalities, — <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20, 21.</p>
               <p>That Angels ſhould be ſervants to them, who by nature are inferiour to them, is ground of a temptation to them, (had not grace over-powered nature) to take all occaſions againſt Saints, to bring God out of love with them, and to bring themſelves again into the higheſt place of Gods favour.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Angels may be ſuppoſed to endanger Saints, not induſtriouſly but occaſionally, by reaſon of the corruption that remains in our natures.</p>
               <p>What through the excellency of their Natures, their nearneſs to God, and the many good ſervices they perform to us, Saints have been endangered to commit idolatry with them. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.8. hence that caution of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18, 19. hereby ſome are in danger to quit Jeſus Chriſt the Head.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59234:49"/>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to ſhew, that Angels ſhall not be able to ſeparate.—</p>
               <p n="1">I. They will not.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in regard of their Office; they are all miniſtring ſpirits ſent forth,— <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they will not be enemies to them, but are in a readineſs to execute the wrath of God upon all that offend them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they have a charge to keep them in all their ways, <hi>Pſal</hi> 91.11, 12. not to lead them out of Gods way.</p>
               <p n="2">II. They cannot if they would.</p>
               <p>Firſt, their ſubjection to Chriſt, they are under his dominion and ſovereignty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their dependance upon Chriſt for the execution and performance of all they do; The viſion of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, compared with <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Angels attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt at his Birth, in the Wilderneſs when tempted, in the Garden at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they can do nothing but what God commands them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59234:49"/>
               <p n="3">III. If they could they dare not.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they have their eſtabliſhment in Chriſt. They were by nature as mutable as the reſt that fell, they are fetled in a ſtate of love in God by Chriſt, teſtified by the Cherubims on the Mercy-Seat.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are by Chriſt brought into the ſame Fellowſhip and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God as we, <hi>Eph</hi> 1.10. ſee what the Angel himſelf declared, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9. and we are ſaid to be brought into Communion with Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22.23. if they ſhould endeavor to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate believers from Communion with God in his love, they ſhould alſo ſeparate themſelves.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This informs us, that no creature ture in Heaven not the pureſt Angels, can be any part of our eſſential bleſſedneſs: Theſe Angels may in caſe of diſobedience actually inſtict the Tokens of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt us: And occaſionally, through our own corruption, prove ſnares and temptations to us, ſuch as may endanger our ſtate in Gods love;

This alone conſiſts in our Immediate Communion with God in love, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, from which nothing can ſeparate us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Uſe.</hi> This ſerves to confirm the faith of believers in the aſſurance of their unchangeable ſtate in Gods love; there is an utter impoſſibility to ſeparate them from it.</p>
               <p>The Angels excel in ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. if they cannot do it, much leſs can inferiour creatures, Men or Devils what is beyond the power of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is an abſolute impoſſibility to other creatures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Uſe.</hi> By this we are informed, that thoſe things, thoſe Agents ſometimes we greatly fear, as enemies that may endanger us in our chiefeſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are often our greateſt friends, and ſuch as really deſign our greateſt good.</p>

               <p>For though not actively, yet occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, through good angels they are utterly fallen from that love of God, that Communion with God in Chriſt they profeſſed.</p>

               <p>No wonder therefore if the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt and his Saints, be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,

               <p>Fourthly, it is <hi>Regnum Nihilitudinis,</hi> A Kingdom of Self-denial; To which the Principalities of the World are moſt abſolutely averſe.

               <p>The ſubjects of this Kingdom are put to walk by ſaith, not by ſight, to believe things they have not ſeen, to hope for things they know not; the Kingdom of Chriſt in appearance is an ignoble thing.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, becauſe Chriſt is both King of Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and King of Nations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. This renders him and his Saints invincible, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14.

               <p>Thirdly, let us conſider how much theſe Powers of darkneſs engage their power, policy, malice, by all their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, accuſations to ſeparate, —For we are ſaid to wreſtle— <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>If devils envied Mans ſtate in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, in love before man fell from God, how much more to ſee man reſtored, and themſelves caſt off for ever.</p>

               <p>Secondly, they oppoſe our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Chriſt, through whom we have Communion with God again in love.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt came into the world to redeem men into Communion with God again and his love, what mighty ſtrong oppoſition did he make againſt him, he muſtered up all the Powers of the world, and all the Powers of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, they mightily oppoſe our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, or being the ſons of God, which is the greateſt manifeſtation of that love of God through Chriſt. No ſooner was Chriſt declared the Son of God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. but the firſt temptation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Devil aſſaulted him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.3. was concerning this, when the Spirit of Adoption hath ſecured our Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how many Arguments will the devil draw from our ſpiritual wants, weakneſs,

               <p>Fifthly, they make ſtrong oppoſition againſt that righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified, which is the life of faith, and our neareſt fitneſs for Communion with God.

               <p>Sixthly, they make mighty oppoſition againſt that grace and holineſs in which we continue our Communion with God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6, 7. If a childe of the devil be ſuch an enemy to all grace, what is the father, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.10.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let us conſider what great

               <p>Firſt, there is yet remaining much darkneſs in them: darkneſs of ſin, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, unbelief, unmortified luſts and affections, and the devil is the Ruler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the darkneſs of this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the impotency of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by reaſon of which he can more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prevail with Saints, then formerly with <hi>Eve,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. it was but a buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting, and but from a Meſſenger of Satan, yet all <hi>Pauls</hi> grace was too weak to reſiſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, yet we ſhall ſhew, that all the Powers of Devils, and all the Rulers of the Kingdom of Hell and Darkneſs ſhall not be able to ſeparate—</p>

               <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath ſtated their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in himſelf, on himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, none of his remptations ſhall

               <p>Fifthly, becauſe greater is he in Saints then,— 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.4. is the devil a ſtrong man, Chriſt is ſtronger, <hi>Luke</hi> 1, 22. is he a lion, ſo is Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.5. is he a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſo is Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Uſe.</hi> Sinners who are yet in your unregeneracy look about, you are yet under the power, policy, malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:

               <p>An Argument the devil ſtill holds poſſeſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. Make haſte to Chriſt, who alone can caſt him, though a Legion, in one man, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.8. he made the devils to cry, roar, tremble, he caſt them out of mens bodies ſouls unto ſwine.</p>

               <p>A righteous man may ſin ſeven times a day, and ſeven times ſtand in need of Pardon, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.4. and therefore may fall into affliction ſeven times in a day, and riſe again, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24.16.</p>
               <p>Theſe do much endanger our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, becauſe they are very apt, and too often diſturb our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God: They are like ſhowers of rain that fall into brooks or pooles, that muddy all the waters; preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are mingled with temptations; theſe mingle with our corruptions, ſtir our paſſions, trouble the pure waters of grace and comfort for a while; and the ſoul cannot preſently draw waters with joy out of the Well of ſalvation, which is its bleſſed Communion with God.

               <p>Secondly, becauſe they are (though ſometimes they ſee not, feel not) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23. and they who have complained of daily afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have bleſt God for daily mercies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.19.

               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59234:64"/>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe no preſent trouble can ſwallow up the joy that ſprings to believers from future glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, againſt all preſent and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing evils that S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, as for things to come.</p>
               <p>It is with the godly in this life, as with <hi>Solomens</hi> old man; the clouds return af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rain; preſent evils afflict him, and future threaten him, as its ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. One woe is paſt, a ſecond is, and a third woe cometh quickly: Evils to come may much endanger Saints in their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Saints are very ſubject to this temptation, about what may befal
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59234:64"/>them for time to come, as appears by that of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.34. who will not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allow his people one anxious thought about what ſhall fall out on the morrows This temptation hath two evils in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It begets fear and that fear hath great torment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It takes away the reliſh and ſweetneſs of the preſent mercies we enjoy, while we take in a deeper apprehenſion of what troubles are yet to come upon us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe God uſually makes the troubles that are to come heavier then the preſent; the waters of affliction like the waters of the Sanctuary, riſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, higher and higher, from the Ancles to the Knees, — <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the trials and troubles of the Church which are to come, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly like to be the greateſt.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which more immediately precede the coming of Chriſt, very dangerous and great for ſin, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.—5. and for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25, 26.</p>
               <p>Yet no troubles to come ſhall be able to ſeparate.—</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe all things ſhall certainly work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>we know</hi> (there is no doubt, heſitancy, uncertainty in this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) <hi>that all things</hi> (things preſent and things to come, all things, none excepted) <hi>ſhall work</hi> (all things that have any ſpirit, power, vertue, activity in it, that works to any end) <hi>ſhall work together</hi> (all Agents, Inſtruments God ſhall make uſe of, how various in their kinds, how different in their operations, how diſtinct in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, yet they ſhall all work together

               <p>Secondly, from the immutability of Gods love, it is everlaſting, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.3. God is not as man that he ſhould repent, whom he loves he loves to the end.</p>

               <p>Yet ſhall not the Heights of God ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.—</p>
               <p>Firſt, for this Heights, this Sublimity of God keeps in Saints a holy frame of ſpirit
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59234:69"/>towards God, a holy care to pleaſe him, and a holy fear to offend him, <hi>Iob</hi> 13.11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe ſublime high Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of God in himſelf (which are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above the holieſt creatures, and which they cannot bear) are made uſe of to drive them from God in himſelf (who is a God above us, and a God againſt us) to God in Chriſt, to God in a Covenant of grace: where he is <hi>Emanuel, God with us, God for us,</hi> Hab. 3.16.—18.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe ſublime high Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God are made uſe of to humble Saints, as <hi>Iob, Iſaiah, Daniel,</hi> and then the high God appears merciful and gracious to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, though the ſublime, high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Appearances of God be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Comprehenſions of Saints, yet they are matter of their praiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.1.</p>
               <p>The Angels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. praiſe, admire, adore, magnifie God in that glory they could not bear or behold.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is another Height or Sublimity that greatly endangers a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59234:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtate in his Communion. — that is, ſpiritual pride, or ſelf-exaltation.</p>
               <p>Spiritual pride is a lifting up of the heart to a height, above what becomes a godly man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p>Such graces as are eſſential to ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and holineſs, are all joyned with humility, and have a ſelf-humbling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4.</p>
               <p>But ſuch gifts and graces as are common to true believers and temporaries, often beget ſpiritual pride in the hearts of the beſt Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2, 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p>This height, this carnal ſublimity in the heart doth much endanger a believers ſtate in his—</p>
               <p>Firſt, this height hath a great Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. though a true believer cannot fall ſo low, it often occaſioneth great falls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it will be j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> ground of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to a believer, to fear he is deceived in all his ſpiritual concernments, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, its a ſin diametrally oppoſite to free grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, 7.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59234:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Fourthly, it takes the Crown off God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Head, and ſets upon its own, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.1. God gives his grace to many, his glory to none, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 29.31. This makes him to reſiſt the proud.</p>
               <p>Secondly, yet ſhall not this height, how dangerous ſoever, ſeparate a believer.—</p>
               <p>Firſt, this ſpiritual pride is but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcency, a luxuriancy, a ſucker, that may ſpring forth from a branch that is truly engrafted into the true Vine Jeſus Chriſt; and God the Father hath promiſed to purge it and take it away, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.1, 2. It is a weed that ſprings up in Chriſts Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and commonly among the ſweeteſt and choiceſt flowers, and Chriſt will not ſuffer it to ſtand long.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God will take advantage by ſuch ſpiritual pride to humble his people; when <hi>Paul</hi> began to glory, he preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſools him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2.11. when he began to boaſt himſelf, then he became preſently nothing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if Chriſtians grow to an height of ſpiritual pride, in the contemplation of their ſpiritual gifts; graces, priviledges,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59234:70"/>God will quickly give them a humbling ſight of their weakneſſes, corruptions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.22. 24, 26.</p>
               <p>The Peacock ſtruts it ſelf while it looks on its gay Plumes, and is aſhamed when it looks on its black feet; when <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger of being up with his priviledges, God turns his eye to look on his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there are heights in believers of carnal confidence, when to ſpiritual priviledges of grace and comfort, God ſhall adde temporal favours, riches, honours, outward glory, worldly proſperity.</p>
               <p>Such a ſtate of worldly felicity, is call'd the height, ſublimity and exaltation of a perſon, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 31.5.</p>
               <p>Such heights, ſome underſtand to be meant in the text, a ſtate of worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and grandeur, wealth, power and authority;— which God ſometimes vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to ſome of his children to convince the world, that he can do much more for his then the world for hers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this height may much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59234:71"/>a believers Communion with God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to beget carnal ſecurity under preſent enjoyments, and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh God to hide his face, and ſo the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Communion with God is much diſturbed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6: 7.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it affords matter for a great Temptation of the Devil, the world and its glory the devil ſhewed Chriſt on a high Mountain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe things have been great trials to Saints, and made proof of their weakneſs, in the midſt of their higheſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; as in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> a <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.27, 28, 29, 31. God left him to try him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Yet ſhall not theſe heights be able to ſeparate.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe God will not ſuffer them long to rejoyce in theſe enjoyments, but rather in an humble frame of ſpirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are enabled to manage ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to the glory of God, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of others; ſee <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.9, 10</p>
               <p>Secondly, if worldly enjoyments ſeek to ſeparate us from God he will quickly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from us; If <hi>Hezekias</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59234:71"/>lift up his heart, they muſt go to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, Iſa.</hi> 39.6.</p>
               <p>When the diſciples were over-raviſht with the external glory of that Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. and ſaid, <hi>It is good to be here;</hi> God brought a cloud over the glory preſently, and made them contented with their Communion with Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe whatever enjoyments all worldly felicity God vouchſafeth his people; the comforts that flow in to them from theſe are weak, narrow, ſcanty, full of inſufficiency, diſſatisfaction: God limits the comfort of outward things to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, more then to the men of the world.</p>
               <p>The fulneſs, the ſufficiency of all ſpiritual comfort flows from their Communion with God, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3, 4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there is another height that is raiſed by the workings of carnal reaſon, in thoughts, opinions, falſe judgments and concluſions, which lift up themſelves above the truths of God, and ſomtimes above the ways and dealings of God; this height you have 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.

               <p n="1">I. I ſhall declare what I mean by Depths'</p>
               <p>I underſtand principally thoſe Depths and Dejections of ſoul that attend a ſtate of darkneſs and ſpiritual deſertion, incident not only to Saints in lower, but to Saints in their higher capacity of grace, according to the good pleaſure of Gods Will.</p>
               <p>This ſtate hath a great Depth and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity in it, that Pſalm wholly expreſſeth ſuch a ſtate; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.1. and that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.6— in the Deeps.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:59234:73"/>
               <p>This is ſuch a Depth into which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deeps empty themſelves as Rivers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ocean.</p>
               <p>Firſt, into this Deep falls in the Depths of ſin; ſin is a deep thing, lies deep, out of ſight; Saints ſeldom ſearch to the bottom of it but in caſe of ſpiritual deſertion, nor can they then ſound the Depth without Gods Plummet, <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 13.23, 24.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate God doth uſually ſearch the ſin of Saints to the bottom, <hi>Job</hi> in this caſe was made to repoſſeſs the fins of his youth; <hi>David</hi> was made to reckon for the ſin he ſtood guilty of in the Womb, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. in a ſtate of ſpiritual deſertion, Saints have uſually a diſcovery of the depth of guilt and blackneſs, and ugly deformity in ſin, beyond what they had at firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, into this depth of ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion falls in the depth of Gods wrath, his Judgements are called a Deep, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. ſo deep, that the damned in Hell are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinking into them, and ſhall never come to the bottom.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59234:74"/>
               <p>In this ſtate of ſpiritual deſertion, Saints take deep of the wrath of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, into this Deep falls in the depths of Satan, deep temptations: as it was with Chriſt in this condition, ſo 'tis in its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Saints; now the devil and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſs beſtir themſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.33.

               <p>Fourthly, into this Deep falls the depths of Hell; Hell is deep and large, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. <hi>ult.</hi> nothing deeper, <hi>Job</hi> 11.8. the bottomleſs Pit, <hi>Rev</hi> 7.1.</p>

                  </gap> already kindled Hell fire in the foul.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, into this Deep falls the depth of ſorrow and affliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. ſee the title; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69, 1, 2. here is Complaint, ſee his Prayer, <hi>ver</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>No ſorrows like theſe, no afflictions ſo deep as theſe, they enter into the ſoul: here often miſery appears remedileſs, and the foul expects endleſs ſorrow, yea, refuſeth all the comforts that are adminiſtred from any hand but Gods alone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. Thus you fee, ſpiritual deſertion is a Depth into which many Deeps fall; the Depth of ſin' wrath, Satan, — one Deep here calleth on another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us conſider how much theſe Depths may endanger to ſeparate a believer.—</p>
               <p>Firſt, in this ſtate Saints apprehend a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59234:75"/>total ceſſation of Gods love to them, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting night on them, that the light of Gods Countenance ſhall never ſhine on them more, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.4. <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight: Thus they ſay, The Lord will caſt off for ever— Pſal.</hi> 77.8, 9. ſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 13.1. <hi>How long—for ever. In the favour of God is life,</hi> Pſal. 30.5. <hi>If he frown who can live; In his favour is light, if he hide his face who can behold him,</hi> Job 34.29.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this ſtate God may ſeem to withdraw that Spirit, which is the bond of our Communion with God; hence that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11, 12.</p>
               <p>The Spirit in this ſtate uſeth to ſuſpend its Teſtimony, refuſe light to our Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and withhold that witneſs it formerly bare to our Adoption; yea, it may ſuffer Satan to bear falſe witneſs to our ſpirits, and perſwade us that we are hypocrites, children of wrath, fitting for deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in this ſtate God calls to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance ſins, which the ſoul thought had long ſince been repented of, and that God had pardoned. Thus were the ſins of <hi>Jobs</hi> youth, and <hi>Davids</hi> original ſin, thus
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59234:75"/>a believer may be brought to queſtion all Gods former Acts of grace, and his own faith and repentance, and ſuſpect all his former comforts, yea, the being of any grace at all in truth: and this is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is a ſtate of darkneſs and no light, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1. Now he that walks in darkneſs knows not,— <hi>John</hi> 12.35. ſo theſe knew not what to do, what way to take— He that walks in darkneſs trembles at every thing; even the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of grace are ſtumbling blocks to that ſoul.</p>
               <p>In darkneſs are terrible apprehenſions, as to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the Plague of darkneſs, <hi>Pſal</hi> 78.49. the terrours of God are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Saints in ſpiritual deſertions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15, 16. <hi>Job</hi> 7.14.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, in this ſtate God ſeems for the preſent to neglect all their Prayers, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.8. Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Saints here are ready to ſay as <hi>Saul, The Lord is departed from me, and anſwereth me no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:59234:76"/>
               <p>Sixthly, in this ſtate the ſoul ſuffers, the affliction is on the ſpirit of a man; its a wound on the ſpirit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. a Dagger at the heart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.10. ſee Chriſt in his Deſertion, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> 26.38. <hi>Heman</hi> ſuffered not in his inferiour only, but in the ſuperiour faculties of his ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15. In other afflictions the body ſuffers, and the ſoul only by ſympathy; here the ſoul ſuffers and the body only by ſympathy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let us conſider theſe depths ſhall never be able to ſeparate.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Becauſe they are all conſiſtent with love, and always end in love.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are conſiſtent with love, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5, 6. he ſeems, if not only, yet princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to intend the Caſtigation that fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſouls and ſpirits of believers. God never loved Chriſt better, then at that time when he cried out, <hi>My God, My God</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſephs</hi> bowels yearn'd moſt when he dealt moſt roughly with his brethren; ſo God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.20.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Be ſure all will end in love. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54: 7, 8. <hi>Cant.</hi> 31, 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe theſe Depths of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59234:78"/>to endanger a ſeparation between God and a believer in ſweet Communion, in which the Apoſtle in the name of all believers, comes off with victory.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider what is meant by this expreſſion,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Nor any other creature</hi>—The Apoſtle having reckoned up all known Adverſaries in this cauſe by name; he riſeth higher, and ſpeaks by way of ſuppoſition.

               <p>I doubt not but to overcome it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Nor any other creatures.</hi> By crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture here (ſaith a learned Author) we are to underſtand all things that are done in the world,
<note place="margin">Gry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad, and all the thoughts, words, actions, employments, councels, contrivances of men, Angels, Devils, with all other creatures within the Compaſs of the whole Citation of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Nor any other creature</hi>—the word rendred Creature is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which often ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59234:79"/>the Creation, the whole Creation.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle had hitherto encountred the enemy in Parties and ſingle Regiments, but now he encounters the whole body, he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters up all the enemies he had before ſpoken of, into one body; he fears not to encounter the united ſtrength and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned power and rage of the whole Creation, If all creatures ſhould riſe up together with one hand and one heart to endeavor to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate—<hi>They ſhall not be able</hi>—</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>Not the Concurring Power of the whole Creation of God, if they were in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, can be able to ſeparate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I ſhall prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The concurrent power and endeavour of the whole Creation cannot make God to be againſt his people who are in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balak</hi> hired <hi>Balaam</hi> to do this work, to ſeparate God from his people; <hi>Balaam</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all means to this end, he offered ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, he uſed inchantments and divinations, but nothing could prevail, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. God is not as man—ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaks as a man aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59234:79"/>fill'd with abundance of evidence and aſſurance in this point, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31. <hi>If God befor us.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Such as have <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with them, God in Communion with them, have alſo God for them, and what can the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent power of the creature do againſt them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that that love of God which hath gathered believers into this bleſſed Communion with God, and ſtill embraceth them in the lofteſt Armes of Peace; it is everlaſting as God is, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.3. It takes hold on both Eternities, that which is paſt, and that which is to come; This Love runs Parallel with the Life of God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Eternity.</p>
               <p>Can the concurrent wrath, rage and malice of the whole Creature, bring God out of love with them, whom he loved from everlaſting; Is there more power in the wrath of the Creature, then in the love of God? Can the poor Creature make that not to be, which God hath made to be from Eternity, to be for Eternity?</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:59234:80"/>
               <p>Thirdly, the golden Chain of ſalvation cannot be broken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. The two extreme links in this Chain are Election and Glorification; the two middle links are Vocation and Juſtification. This ſeems to be the Chain which ſo much raviſht the heart of Chriſt about the neck of his Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9. The two ends of this Chain God keeps in his own hands in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the two middle links are thoſe God lets down from Heaven, and ſo draws us up to himſelf, and linketh us faſt to himſelf for ever.</p>
               <p>What Confederacy or Combination of the creature, can pull the Son out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
               <p>Further, can they pluck any end of this Chain out of Gods Hand. Can they riſe up and blot out the book of life, and raſe out the names that are written in Heaven. Can Creatures, ſome whereof are in Chains of darkneſſe, all in iron Chains of divine Providence, break that golden Chain of grace, in which believers are kept cloſe in Communion with God.</p>
               <p>Can the concurrent Power of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59234:80"/>riſe up and cancel the great Charter of ſalvation, whoſe records are kept in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the concurrent power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of all creatures cannot ſeparate them from Chriſt in whom they have this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in love.</p>
               <p n="1">I. They are ſaid to be in the Hand of Chriſt, which Hand gives them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. what creature can pluck them out.</p>
               <p n="2">II. They are ſaid to be engraven on the Palmes of his hand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.16. what is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven cannot be taken out, without mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Hand of Chriſt. If you could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they could be taken out of Chriſts Hand as looſe things, yet they cannot as engraven things, will Chriſt ſuffer his Hand to be maculated or cut off.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They are ſaid to be in the Armes of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. They are ſealed on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="4">IV. They are not only on, but in the

               <p n="7">VII. They are not only on the ſhoulders, but in the eye of Chriſt, as the Apple in the eye, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.8.</p>

               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>But the Apoſtle ſeems to ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Secondly, he hath ſaid to the utmoſt, <hi>I will never, never, never—leave thee,</hi> Heb. 13.5, 6.</p>

               <p>Secondly, never any true believer made the leaſt ſeparation from God, but they quickly found a difference, and readily return'd to him again with bitter repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7.</p>

               <p>This was <hi>Bernards</hi> Poſition, but I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sin is a creature, not Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but the devils; every ſin is a Lie, and the devil is the father of it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. Therefore.</p>

               <p>Secondly, former ſins cannot, they are pardoned; after-ſins ſhall not, they have an Advocate and a Propitiation, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.2.</p>
